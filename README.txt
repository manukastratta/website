Hello, future Swingtime web masters, this is a README written by someone who
largely does not know what a lot of the stuff in here is here for.

Currently, the two files that will probably need to be updated are:
home.html
js.banner.js

Permissions may be granted to future webmasters here:
http://web.stanford.edu/services/afs/sysadmin/userguide/file-permissions.html.

This repo is version controlled through git. It looks like once upon a time it
was version controlled through copying and pasting (oldsite, rachelsite)? And
perhaps through CVS, I'm not sure.

Some of the following files appear to be no longer used, but I am not brave
enough to delete them myself:

Previous iterations of the site?
rachelsite/
oldsite/
oldcss/
oldimages/

Audition photos?
sun_aud_photos_rotated/

Some mystical black magic?
reviews/

A copy of AFS man page?
qq

These are not tracked in Git. Delete at your own peril.

This Git repo is also not hosted anywhere, meaning that the copy in this
directory is the only copy that exists. Probably sometime in the future, we
will want to make backups to github or bitbucket.
