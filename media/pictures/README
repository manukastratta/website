Creating an album:

   1. Add a new date directory (yyyy-mm-dd)

   2. Add photo and thumbnail files *_600.jpg and *_T.jpg to the date
      directory.  Create an ORDER file and add each photo (without the
      _600.jpg or _T.jpg suffix) to the file.  If you wish to add
      captions or cite the photographer, the format of the ORDER file
      is as follows:

      [photo]: [caption] & [taken by]

      Note that you can use convert_pics.pl to generate the _600, _T,
      and ORDER files automatically:

      ./convert_pics.pl [source directory] [destination directory]

   3. Create a TITLE file with the album's title
   
   4. Add a title picture to the MAIN_LIST file

   5. Run ./create.sh
