Swingtime is a high energy swing dance troupe dedicated 
to bringing the fun, excitement, and flair of swing dancing
to Stanford. Swingtime's performances are known not only
for their fast-paced lindy hop with jaw-dropping aerials but
also their smooth and sexy swing moves. You never know
what to expect with Swingtime - they've even been
caught swinging to hip-hop on occasion! You can find
Swingtime performing at many dance events such as
Ragtime Ball, Viennese Ball, Big Dance, and of course,
the annual Swingtime Spring Show.  Swingtime guarantees
to bring a smile to every face at every performance!
