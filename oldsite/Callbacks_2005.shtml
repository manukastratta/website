<p><b>Evaluation:</b> Auditionees are evaluated based on a variety of factors including technique (both swing
<i>and</i> more general dance techniques), style, lead/follow ability, and performance potential
(ability to bring energy, fun, and poise to their dancing).  Most of important of all factors are
expressive dancing and personality, energetic performing, and ability to learn dance quickly. We
observe auditionees (both live and on film) and consider feedback they receive from our members
and from each other in our unique <i>Peer Review</i> process.

<p><b>Callbacks Timeline:</b>
<ul>
   <li> <b>Callbacks (Mon, Oct 10, 8:30-11pm):</b> Callbacks are similar to auditions. However, with a smaller group,
   we are able to provide more individual attention, teaching, and feedback and perform more comprehensive evaluations.
   <li> <b>Callbacks peer reviews (due Tues, Oct 11, 5pm):</b> Same as auditions.
   <li> <b>New members confirm joining group (by Thur, Oct 13, 5pm):</b> New members are invited via email (sent on a
   rolling basis) to join and asked to confirm their membership within 24 hours. Once all slots are filled, the new
   group is annouced on our website and remaining auditionees are informed of our decision.
   <li> <b> Retreat for all members (Sat, Oct 15, through Sun, Oct 16):</b> Group retreat, mandatory for all
   new members.
