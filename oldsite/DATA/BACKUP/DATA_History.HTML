The Swingtime Swing Dance Troupe was founded in 2002 by four Stanford
students &#150; <b>Andy Huang</b>, <b>Meg Kale</b>, <b>Maria Reese</b>,
and <b>Darick Tong</b> &#150; with the help of former
<a href="http://dance.stanford.edu/vintage/default.html"> Vintage Dance
Ensemble</a> Director, <b>Richard Powers</b>, and Dance Captains, <b>Ryan
and Monica Shen Knotts</b>. Their goal was to create a student-based
swing dance troupe with an emphasis on precision and artistic flair to
continue on the tradition of excellence of Vintage.

<p><b>2002-2003:</b> Swingtime's foundational first year was hallmarked
by a balance of new and old. Its roster of nine couples boasted a mix of
seasoned veterans from Vintage, dancers from a variety of other backgrounds,
and students new to both swing and performance, while its repertoire featured
a collection of classic Vintange choreographies like <i>Flying Home</i>,
professional choreographies like the high-flying <i>Leave Us Leap</i> by
<a href="http://www.yeahman.com/rdone.html">Rob and Diane van Haaren</a>,
and innovative in-house choreographies like the sultry <i>Stray Cat Strut</i>
by Darick Tong. Swingtime also began its most distinctive tradition, its
Spring-quarter <i>Cat's Corner</i> piece, done in the style of the old
<a href="http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/z3savoy1.htm">Savoy Ballroom</a>
"Cat's Corner," featuring individual couples taking turns showing off their
hottest moves. Swingtime appeared at a variety of venues, on and off campus,
including a Stanford Men's Basketball Halftime Show, Stanford's 26th Annual
Viennese Ball, and Rhythms 2003.  To cap off its first year, Swingtime
organized its <i>Swingtime Presents...</i> Spring show to showcase the talent
and hard work of Swingtime's members and supporters and bring together other
dance groups to present a creative and entertaining show that filled the Roble
Studio to capacity.

<p><b>2003-2004:</b> Swingtime's second year saw it maintaining the standards of
excellence it set in its first year and growing the group to an unprecedented
size of 12 couples. This larger size allowed it to try ambitious larger pieces
like professional choreography <i>Back Bay Shuffle</i> by Catrine Ljunggren and
to experiment with more duets in its <i>Cat's Corner</i> piece. It also focused
on developing its dancers and saw vast improvement in the dancing
and performing of its less-experienced members. Swingtime increased the number
and variety of its performances, including performing on a fashion-show catwalk
as a part of the Hat Walk 2003 fundraiser for the Asian American Cancer
Support Network, returning to the 27th Annual Viennese Ball, and appearing in
both Stanford Dance Division's annual Spring Migration show and Knotts Dance
Company's anniversary Stepping Out show. In addition Artistic Director <b>Meg
Kale</b> and member <b>Kari Doyle</b> served as choreographers for
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/rams-head/">Stanford Ram's
Head Theatrical Society's</a> Spring production of
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/rams-head/archives/sprshow/04/index.shtml">
<i>Kiss Me, Kate</i></a>, while member <b>Dave Kale</b> joined the chorus as a singer
and dancer. Meg and Dave danced in the show-stopping number <i>Too Darn Hot</i>.

<p><b>2004-2005:</b> Swingtime's third year will be long-remembered as its break-out
year, a year of innovation and excitement. It started off with a bang as Swingtime
invited old and current members to join
it as it appeared at one of its most memorable gigs, the <i>Palo Alto Black & White
Ball</i>. A large turnover of members allowed Swingtime to shrink its group size to 10
couples, mix it up, and begin training a new generation of student dancers. The
younger dancers brought an unmatched enthusiasm and work ethic and allowed Swingtime
to connect with its student audiences in a way its never has before. This year also
saw the debut of choreographies by members <b>Meg Kale</b> and <b>Kari Doyle</b>.
Kari demonstrated her experience with vintage dancing and costuming in <i>Seafood Mama</i>
and <i>Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy</i> (performed by a small ensemble). With the help of
her brother Dave, Meg created two of Swingtime's most memorable pieces ever: crowd-favorite
<i>Hey Ya!</i>, featuring urban costumes and challenging jazz steps, and Swingtime's
most ambitious piece ever, <i>Straight Up</i>, featuring formations and the most high-flying
aerials of any Swingtime piece. Swingtime also shook up its <i>Cat's Corner</i> lineup,
featuring two single-sex couples (one men, one women) and one couple dancing role-reversal.
Swingtime also formed strong relationships with other dance groups, appearing in the
<a href="http://dancemarathon.stanford.edu/">2005 Stanford Dance Marathon</a>,
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/cardinalballet/">Cardinal Ballet's</a> campus-reknowned
<i>Urban Nights</i> Dance Fusion show, and <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/salseros/">
Los Salseros de Stanford's</a> Spring <i>Salsa Picante</i> show. Swingtime's Spring show,
<i>Saturday Night Live '05</i>, featured the amazing <i>a capella</i> musical stylings of the
<a href="http://www.stanfordharmonics.com">Stanford Harmonics</a> and was Swingtime's
highest attended Spring show ever, leaving not even standing room.

<p>Swingtime has established itself as one of the premier swing dance troupes in the Bay Area
with its precise, high-energy style of dance yet remains dedicated to its original charter of
providing students with amazing opportunities to learn high-quality swing, stuning jazz moves,
and awe-inspiring aerials and put it all together to exciting music, great costumes, and
cheering crowds, both on and off campus.
