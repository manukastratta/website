Swingtime is a performance-based swing dance troupe that works with
professional choreographers, dance historians, and dance legends to
recreate swing-era dances and integrate current trends.  Swingtime's
repertoire ranges from smooth swing with sleek moves to fast-paced
Lindy Hop with jaw-dropping aerials.  We are continually pressing the
limits of how smooth, fast, and high we can go.
