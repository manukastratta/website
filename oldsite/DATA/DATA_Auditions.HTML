Swingtime is excited to announce 2006 auditions! We are looking
for dedicated leads and follows to light up the stage with their
skill, enthusiasm, and energy. A willingness to learn, work, and
perfect your dancing is the only requirement!  Come to our auditions
(basically a free fast-paced lesson). See our
<a href="http://swingtime.stanford.edu/FAQ.shtml">FAQ</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE: There will be a swing and lindy hop basic workshop taught by
Swingtime alumni siblings Meg and Dave Kale on Sunday, Oct 1, 6-8pm,
in Roble 52 (Gym). </b>The workshop is not an official part of auditions,
nor is it required for auditionees, but it will likely prove helpful,
whether as an introduction or a review.<br>

<p><b>Who should audition:</b> Everyone!  We teach members everything they need to know to
perform successfully.  We welcome any kind of dance background as beneficial (they tend to
learn very fast and contribute artistically sooner) but do not require it.  We are particularly
enthusiastic about dancers with strong backgrounds who are interested in choreographing and
interested in taking on artistic duties in the future.  For an idea of the diversity of our
backgrounds, see the <a href="http://swingtime.stanford.edu/FAQ.shtml">FAQ</a>

<p><b>Process:</b> Auditions are conducted in two rounds. To accommodate the large number of
auditionees we anticipate, we have split auditions into two sections, both to be held on
the night of Monday, October 2. Auditionees need only
attend one section of their choice. The first round includes social dancing with both Swingtime
members and other auditionees, a crash-course on lindy hop technique and style, and then a
chance to learn an exclusive Swingtime choreography. A subset of auditionees from the first
round are "called back" for the second round, which is operated more like a  typical Swingtime
rehearsal.  Past auditionees have found our auditions process a great deal of fun; it is
fast-paced and demanding but not stressful at all! <b>NOTE: This year Swingtime plans to hold
a special "pre-auditions" workshop for those interested in learning or reviewing the basics of
swing and lindy hop. Time and location have yet to be nailed down, but the workshop will be
held during the afternoon on Saturday, September 30. This will be a good chance to get a feel
for both the dance and the group, not to mention get a jump start on the basic technique of
the dance.</b>

<p><b>Evaluation:</b> Auditionees are evaluated based on a variety of factors including technique (both swing
<i>and</i> more general dance techniques), style, lead/follow ability, and performance potential
(ability to bring energy, fun, and poise to their dancing).  Different components of the process (social dancing,
workshops, choreography, etc.) are weighed equally.  Finally, Swingtime's auditions are unique insofar as we
give auditionees the chance to contribute to our evaluation process through the <i>Peer Review</i> process, which
will be explained in more detail at auditions.
