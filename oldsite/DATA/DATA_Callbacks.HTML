Swingtime is happy to announce its 2006 Callbacks. Auditionees who have
been called back have been contacted by email and are asked to show
up on the night of Wednesday, Oct 4, in Roble 52 (the
old fencing room) from 7-9pm. <b>Please show up at least 15 minutes
(and preferably more) early.</b>

Callbacks function as the first Swingtime rehearsal of the year, giving
us an opportunity to see how auditionees fit into the group, as well as
how quickly they can learn and master technique, choreography, and performance.
They will be evaluated according to the same criteria used for auditions, but
Swingtime members will have a chance to dance with auditionees more and take a
closer look at each individual. Once again, auditionees again be asked to fill
out peer review forms.

<b>Callbacks auditionees are asked to review the choreography taught at auditions
so that we can quickly move on to new material. To assist them, we're making some
<a href="In_The_Mood.shtml">choreography notes</a> available
<a href="In_The_Mood.shtml">here</a> as well as the
<a href="../media/mp3/Glenn Miller - In The Mood.mp3">music here</a>. Good luck!</b>
