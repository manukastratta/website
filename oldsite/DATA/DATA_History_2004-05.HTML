<i>The Swingtime Swing Dance Troupe was founded in 2002 by four Stanford
students &#150; <b>Andy Huang</b>, <b>Meg Kale</b>, <b>Maria Reese</b>,
and <b>Darick Tong</b> &#150; with the help of former
<a href="http://dance.stanford.edu/vintage/default.html"> Vintage Dance
Ensemble</a> Director, <b>Richard Powers</b>, and Dance Captains, <b>Ryan
and Monica Shen Knotts</b>. Their goal was to create a student-based
swing dance troupe with an emphasis on precision and artistic flair to
continue on the tradition of excellence of Vintage.</i>

<p>Swingtime's <b><i>2004-2005 season</i></b> will be long-remembered as its break-out
year, a year of innovation and excitement. It started off with a bang as Swingtime
invited old and current members to join
it as it appeared at one of its most memorable gigs, the <i>Palo Alto Black & White
Ball</i>. A large turnover of members allowed Swingtime to shrink its group size to 10
couples, mix it up, and begin training a new generation of student dancers. The
younger dancers brought an unmatched enthusiasm and work ethic and allowed Swingtime
to connect with its student audiences in a way its never has before. This year also
saw the debut of choreographies by members <b>Meg Kale</b> and <b>Kari Doyle</b>.
Kari demonstrated her experience with vintage dancing and costuming in <i>Seafood Mama</i>
and <i>Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy</i> (performed by a small ensemble). With the help of
her brother Dave, Meg created two of Swingtime's most memorable pieces ever: crowd-favorite
<i>Hey Ya!</i>, featuring urban costumes and challenging jazz steps, and Swingtime's
most ambitious piece ever, <i>Straight Up</i>, featuring formations and the most high-flying
aerials of any Swingtime piece. Swingtime also shook up its <i>Cat's Corner</i> lineup,
featuring two single-sex couples (one men, one women) and one couple dancing role-reversal.
Swingtime also formed strong relationships with other dance groups, appearing in the
<a href="http://dancemarathon.stanford.edu/">2005 Stanford Dance Marathon</a>,
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/cardinalballet/">Cardinal Ballet's</a> campus-reknowned
<i>Urban Nights</i> Dance Fusion show, and <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/salseros/">
Los Salseros de Stanford's</a> Spring <i>Salsa Picante</i> show. Swingtime's Spring show,
<i>Saturday Night Live '05</i>, featured the amazing <i>a capella</i> musical stylings of the
<a href="http://www.stanfordharmonics.com">Stanford Harmonics</a> and was Swingtime's
highest attended Spring show ever, leaving not even standing room.

<p><i>Swingtime has established itself as one of the premier swing dance troupes in the Bay Area
with its precise, high-energy style of dance yet remains dedicated to its original charter of
providing students with amazing opportunities to learn high-quality swing, stuning jazz moves,
and awe-inspiring aerials and put it all together to exciting music, great costumes, and
cheering crowds, both on and off campus.</i>
