<li> How many members are in Swingtime?<p>

Swingtime has varied in size in its first three years, anywhere between 8 and 12 couples.  We usually make a decision about group size after seeing our auditions pool and reevaluating our group values.

<li> What is the time commitment?<p>

We are looking for a nine month school year commitment, though special cases are always considered.  We have two mandatory rehearsals a week, each lasting 2 hours, time and day depending on when we can obtain space.  There are also performances and additional workshops throughout the year.  We will also expect members to participate consistently in a variety of social events, including retreats, periodic outings to off-campus dance venues, etc.

<li> What is the group like?<p>

Swingtime is a closeknit group of friends dedicated to excellence in performing.  We share a love for swing music and all kinds of dancing.  On any given night (when we don't have too much homework), you can find us out dancing or hanging out in each other's dorms rooms.  Our dancers come from a variety of personal and dance backgrounds.  Current and past members include
<ul>
  <li><b>Meg Kale</b> is Swingtime's Artistic Director.  She had an extensive background (tap, jazz, ballet, hip hop, and swing) when she started Swingtime.  She's been dancing with her brother Dave for almost 10 years.  The siblings are expanding their repertoire by delving into hustle, taking private lessons from famous broadway dancers Arte Phillips and Maria Torres.

  <li><b>Jon Gaw</b> had more of a background in martial arts than in dancing when he arrived at Stanford but swiftly became one of the most versatile and creative dancers of the Stanford crowd.  His passion is for salsa, which he fuses with his social swing style.

  <li><b>Marc Rillera</b> is Swingtime's president for the 2005-06 year. While he has performed traditional Filipino dance, he otherwise began dancing at Stanford with a blank slate.  His enthusiasm and work ethic allowed him to steadily improve throughout his first year in Swingtime.

  <li><b>Stephanie Chiang</b> began dancing at Stanford with a background in traditional Chinese dance and joined the Vintage Dance Ensemble before Swingtime.  She began belly-dancing lessons about a year ago which, along with her love for hip hop and salsa, gives her a distinctive swing style that is a little more "hip."<p>

</ul>

<li> What kinds of opportunities will I find in Swingtime?<p>

As a student group, Swingtime's primary mission is to perform students with unique opportunities to add to their Stanford experience.  Swingtime will teach members technically sound swing and jazz and allow them to perform for a variety of audiences, oftentimes including their friends and family.  Swingtime will give members with initiative opportunities to find gigs, choreograph, make artistic and costuming decisions, and take a hand in leading the group in the future.  Swingtime will also provide members with opportunities to form strong relationships with the Stanford and bay area dance communities, Stanford faculty, famous swing instructors and choreographers, other Stanford performing arts groups, and the Stanford student community at large.

<li> Where do you perform?<p>

	Performance venues range from Stanford social dance events (Ragtime, Viennese, Big Dance) to Stanford sporting events (football, basketball) to off-campus charity events (Palo Alto Black and White Ball) to other Stanford groups' shows (Urban Nights, Admit Weekend Dance Expo, Rhythsm) and our own Spring show.  Take a look at our calendars from past years.

<li> Do I need to buy costumes?<p>

	Swingtime buys and owns most of the costuming required.  You may be required to have standard pieces of clothing like khakis, white shirts as well as dance shoes.

<li> Where do your choreographies come from?<p>

	We have a mix of student, faculty, and professional choreographers, listed at <a href="http://swingtime.stanford.edu/Choreographers.html>.  We are lucky to have had the opportunity to work with so many talented choreographers.  To see some clips, visit the <a href="http://swingtime.stanford.edu/Gallery.shtml">Swingtime Gallery</a>.
