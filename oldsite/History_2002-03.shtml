<i>The Swingtime Swing Dance Troupe was founded in 2002 by four Stanford
students &#150; <b>Andy Huang</b>, <b>Meg Kale</b>, <b>Maria Reese</b>,
and <b>Darick Tong</b> &#150; with the help of former
<a href="http://dance.stanford.edu/vintage/default.html"> Vintage Dance
Ensemble</a> Director, <b>Richard Powers</b>, and Dance Captains, <b>Ryan
and Monica Shen Knotts</b>. Their goal was to create a student-based
swing dance troupe with an emphasis on precision and artistic flair to
continue on the tradition of excellence of Vintage.</i>

<p>Swingtime's foundational <i><b>2002-2003</b></i> season was hallmarked
by a balance of new and old. Its roster of nine couples boasted a mix of
seasoned veterans from Vintage, dancers from a variety of other backgrounds,
and students new to both swing and performance, while its repertoire featured
a collection of classic Vintange choreographies like <i>Flying Home</i>,
professional choreographies like the high-flying <i>Leave Us Leap</i> by
<a href="http://www.yeahman.com/rdone.html">Rob and Diane van Haaren</a>,
and innovative in-house choreographies like the sultry <i>Stray Cat Strut</i>
by Darick Tong. Swingtime also began its most distinctive tradition, its
Spring-quarter <i>Cat's Corner</i> piece, done in the style of the old
<a href="http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/z3savoy1.htm">Savoy Ballroom</a>
"Cat's Corner," featuring individual couples taking turns showing off their
hottest moves. Swingtime appeared at a variety of venues, on and off campus,
including a Stanford Men's Basketball Halftime Show, Stanford's 26th Annual
Viennese Ball, and Rhythms 2003.  To cap off its first year, Swingtime
organized its <i>Swingtime Presents...</i> Spring show to showcase the talent
and hard work of Swingtime's members and supporters and bring together other
dance groups to present a creative and entertaining show that filled the Roble
Studio to capacity.

<p><i>Swingtime has established itself as one of the premier swing dance troupes in the Bay Area
with its precise, high-energy style of dance yet remains dedicated to its original charter of
providing students with amazing opportunities to learn high-quality swing, stuning jazz moves,
and awe-inspiring aerials and put it all together to exciting music, great costumes, and
cheering crowds, both on and off campus.</i>
