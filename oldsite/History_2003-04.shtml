<i>The Swingtime Swing Dance Troupe was founded in 2002 by four Stanford
students &#150; <b>Andy Huang</b>, <b>Meg Kale</b>, <b>Maria Reese</b>,
and <b>Darick Tong</b> &#150; with the help of former
<a href="http://dance.stanford.edu/vintage/default.html"> Vintage Dance
Ensemble</a> Director, <b>Richard Powers</b>, and Dance Captains, <b>Ryan
and Monica Shen Knotts</b>. Their goal was to create a student-based
swing dance troupe with an emphasis on precision and artistic flair to
continue on the tradition of excellence of Vintage.</i>

<p>Swingtime's <i><b>2003-2004</b></i> saw it maintaining the standards of
excellence it set in its first year and growing the group to an unprecedented
size of 12 couples. This larger size allowed it to try ambitious larger pieces
like professional choreography <i>Back Bay Shuffle</i> by Catrine Ljunggren and
to experiment with more duets in its <i>Cat's Corner</i> piece. It also focused
on developing its dancers and saw vast improvement in the dancing
and performing of its less-experienced members. Swingtime increased the number
and variety of its performances, including performing on a fashion-show catwalk
as a part of the Hat Walk 2003 fundraiser for the Asian American Cancer
Support Network, returning to the 27th Annual Viennese Ball, and appearing in
both Stanford Dance Division's annual Spring Migration show and Knotts Dance
Company's anniversary Stepping Out show. In addition Artistic Director <b>Meg
Kale</b> and member <b>Kari Doyle</b> served as choreographers for
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/rams-head/">Stanford Ram's
Head Theatrical Society's</a> Spring production of
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/rams-head/archives/sprshow/04/index.shtml">
<i>Kiss Me, Kate</i></a>, while member <b>Dave Kale</b> joined the chorus as a singer
and dancer. Meg and Dave danced in the show-stopping number <i>Too Darn Hot</i>.

<p><i>Swingtime has established itself as one of the premier swing dance troupes in the Bay Area
with its precise, high-energy style of dance yet remains dedicated to its original charter of
providing students with amazing opportunities to learn high-quality swing, stuning jazz moves,
and awe-inspiring aerials and put it all together to exciting music, great costumes, and
cheering crowds, both on and off campus.</i>
