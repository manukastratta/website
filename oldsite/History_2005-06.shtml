<i>The Swingtime Swing Dance Troupe was founded in 2002 by four Stanford
students &#150; <b>Andy Huang</b>, <b>Meg Kale</b>, <b>Maria Reese</b>,
and <b>Darick Tong</b> &#150; with the help of former
<a href="http://dance.stanford.edu/vintage/default.html"> Vintage Dance
Ensemble</a> Director, <b>Richard Powers</b>, and Dance Captains, <b>Ryan
and Monica Shen Knotts</b>. Their goal was to create a student-based
swing dance troupe with an emphasis on precision and artistic flair to
continue on the tradition of excellence of Vintage.</i>

<i>Swingtime has established itself as one of the premiere swing dance troupes in the Bay Area
with its precise, high-energy style of dance yet remains dedicated to its original charter of
providing students with amazing opportunities to learn high-quality swing, stuning jazz moves,
and awe-inspiring aerials and put it all together to exciting music, great costumes, and
cheering crowds, both on and off campus.</i>
