The inspiration for the Swingtime logo is the back-to-back aerial
shown in the picture below.  The script 'S' in the top half of the
logo is an abstract sketch of the girl, legs tucked, at the height of
the aerial.  Below, a script 'T' is formed by the bent-over guy.  The
right side of the logo represents a clock, an allusion to the "time"
in "Swingtime," in which the bottom leg of the 'T' forms an abstract
minute hand and the top of the 'S' forms the hour hand.

<p>The logo's sleek look, the lively motion of the aerial, and the
lighthearted nature of the clock hands captures the various facets of
Swingtime's repetoire and troupe itself.  Finally, the color scheme
matches the look and feel of our costumes,

<p>Special thanks to <a href="http://www.citylinedesign.com">Rich
Shin</a> for his work on the logo's concept and design.
