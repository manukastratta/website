WWW Files and Directories
-------------------------

Archiving last year's files and setting things up for a new year:

   % mkdir SEASON_<YY>_<YY>
   % cp -r *.html *.shtml slideshow.swf global.css create.pl SEASON_<YY>_<YY>
   % cp -r DATA icons images SEASON_<YY>_<YY>
   % cd DATA
   % cp CAL_Current_Season.TXT CAL_<YYYY>-<YY>_Season.TXT

   Edit CAL_Current_Season.TXT to remove all calendar entries

Editing content: DATA directory contains all the content files for
the site's pages

   OUTLINE.TXT: contains a text version of the Web sites menus; each
   top-level menu item and its corresponding submenus are specified,
   one per line, as follows:
   
      <menu item>: <submenu item 1>, <submenu item 2>, ...

   ANNOUNCE.HTML: separate each announcement by a blank line.  You can
   fill space at the end by creating a blank announcement filled with
   as many "&nbsp;<br>" as required.

   Performances: modify CAL_Current_Season.TXT with one line per
   performance -- <date> # <title> # <location> # time.  At the end of
   each season, copy this file to CAL_<####>-<##>_Season.TXT.

   For each main main and submenu item in OUTLINE.TXT, there is a
   DATA_<menu item>.HTML or DATA_<menu item>.TXT file.  If the data
   file is a text file, newlines will be replaced by <br> in HTML.
   With the exception of announcements and performances, edit these
   files to change the content or format.  For announcements and
   performances, edit content as described above.

Making edits appear on the Website:

   create.pl: creates the actual Web site pages using the organization
   detailed in DATA/OUTLINE.TXT, the layout given by the template
   files, and the content in the DATA directory.  To run this script,
   type ./create.pl at the command line in the top-level WWW
   directory.


   NOTE: TMP directory: contains temporary files produced by the
   create.pl script.

Editing layout: TEMPLATES directory contains all the template files
that determine the layout of the site's pages

   MENU/SUBMENU: Top-level menu and submenu layouts

   HOME: content-box layout for the front page

   MAIN: content-box layout for all other pages

   CALENDAR/CREDITS: the content for these pages is dynamically
   generated from other data files; their layout within the main page
   layout is determined by these template files

   NOTE: No actual content except for a few icons/pictures are
   determined by these template pages.
