	<p>We strongly recommend you come to the pre-audition workshop to get ahead of the crowd. There are two audition dates. You can go to one or the other, as both are the same. Callbacks are by invitation only.</p>

	<p><strong>Please arrive *TWENTY (20)* minutes early to auditions to begin the sign-in process. This will ensure that we have as much time for dancing as possible.</strong></p>

	<p class="announcement">Remember, no prior dance experience needed! We are totally serious about this. We welcome all skill levels, and many of our members had never danced before. If you want to have fun and learn to swing dance, please come to auditions!</p>

	<p>If you cannot make one of these dates, or have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact our auditions chairs, Conor Coyan (cecoyan@) and Rachel Vassar (rvassar@).</p>
